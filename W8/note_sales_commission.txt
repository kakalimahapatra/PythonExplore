The car dealer "Acme Auto" sells many types of cars: new cars and used cars, economy cars and luxury cars. A salesperson working for the dealership can earn different type of commission depending on what car he sell. Here are the rules for calculating the sale commission:

For New cars
              				Economy car				Luxury car
Commission			     2.8% of sale price			  3.4% of sale price

For Used cars
              				Economy car				Luxury car
Commission			     3.2% of sale price			  3.5% of sale price

In addition to rules above,  the commision is also adjusted based on  the number of years the salesperson has worked at the dealership:

4  to 8 years                  9 to 16 years            17 years or more
Commission			  Add $150.00		Add $280.00               Add $350.00

This program reads the following 4 user inputs and calculates a sale commission:


-	Car Sale price (can have decimal fraction)
-	New or used car (character N or U input)
-	Economy or luxury car (character E or L input)
-	Number of years salesperson  works at dealership (whole number, 0 or greater)
-	Print only 2 decimal digits for the commision amount 
-	Car sale price must be greater than 0 and cannot exceed $300000.00
-	Your program should print an error message if ‘N’ or ‘U’ is not entered for new/used car


 and ‘E’ or ‘L’ is not entered for economy/luxury car. Also you have to check that car sale price and work years have to be greater than or equal 0.

Here are some sample runs of the program:
