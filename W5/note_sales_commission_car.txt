Python module to do the following:


The code reads the file SALES.TXT, creates a new file TOTALS.TXT. Each line in TOTALS.TXT
contains the total sale for each person. The last line should contain the grand total sales of all
persons.

Use string formatting to right-justified the person names and use a width of 12 for each
sale total on each line.

Use string formatting to give a width of 15 for the grand total sale at the bottom of 
the TOTALS.TXT file.

For example, the TOTALS.TXT file will look like this:

      Name                 Total
    Kelly,Victor             95
        Lam,Gary             87
         .......             XX
         .......             XX

Grand Total:            XXXXXX

The file SALES.TXT should not be modified.
