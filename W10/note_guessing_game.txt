Python program about guessing game with multiple questions / answers. 

For each game, the program generates a random number between 1 and 12.
 
User enters an answer from 1 and 12. If the user input number matches the generated number, then print a message to inform users that he/she has a correct guess. 

If the guess is not correct, allow the user to have two more chances to guess the correct number. 

At any time, if users enter X, then the program should display the game summary and exits. 
The program should keep track of the wins and losses and print the counts when user chooses to 
exit by entering X. 

The program should generate a new random number only after user has entered the correct guess or 
after user has tried 4 times and did not have the right guess. Do not ask user for a yes/no 
confirmation after each game because the X input value will serve as the sentinel to stop the 
continuous games.

--------------------------------------------

Here is a sample run using command line. 

At the program start, it shows:

--------------------------------------------

"Welcome to the number guessing game.
For each game, you have 4 chances to guess a secret number from 1 to 12."

The first time, when a new question is asked, the program displays:

"Enter a number from 1 to 12. Enter X to exit:"


When users give a wrong guess, it shows:

Not correct, try again:

When users give a wrong answer after the fourth trials for the same question, the program displays:

"Not correct. You have reached your fourth trials. The correct number is 1."
"Lets start a new secret number"

When users answer with the correct number, it shows this prompt:

"Congratulation, correct! Let’s start a new secret number."

When users hit X, the game summary is displayed: 

Here is your game summary:
Total games:              	 5
Total game wins:    	 	 3
Total game losses:  	 	 2

How do I generate random numbers in Python?
The standard random module implements a random number generator. 
Usage is simple:

import random


randrange(a, b) gives a random integer in the range [a, b), but b is not included.
